# NR2k3Resultsdb

This is a tool for the game Nascar Racing 2003 Season.
With this tool you can extract race data from the exported html files and make your own championship
with your own race schedule, drivers and your own pointing system.

This program uses Python 3 and MongoDB. You need both of these installed on your system in order to use it.
(I'm planning to add sqlite3 just to lower the requirements but originally I started this project to practice MongoDB.)

*As of September 2018 this program is still in very early alpha stage. More functionality and readme stuff to be added.*
